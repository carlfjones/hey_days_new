                <div class="blurb_title">Hi, welcome to Hey Days furniture!</div>
                <br><br>
                I’m a London girl who did the big sell up 
                and moved to the seaside in 2014. I fell in 
                love instantly with windy walks on the beach, 
                the ever changing sea and the outdoor life.<br><br>

                Having bought a ‘doer upper’ and with very few funds, 
                I learnt a vast range of DIY and handyperson skills 
                very quickly. I sourced second-hand furniture and repaired, 
                renovated and painted it to furnish my home. 
                The results were quirky one-off pieces that brought real 
                character to the rooms and became great talking points 
                when people came to visit.<br><br>

                In late 2014, I started working on furniture that 
                friends and family were intending to throw away, and 
                determined not to see good wood go to waste I refurbished 
                and decorated them creating individually designed 
                bespoke pieces for their owners to love again.<br><br>

                This ignited a passion to save furniture from being destroyed 
                and turn it instead into something beautiful to be used and adored. 
                I love taking previously tired and unwanted furniture, updating 
                it and seeing it proudly displayed and treasured again in someone’s home.<br><br>

                I specialise in creating beautiful, affordable on-off pieces because 
                every room deserves to be made a little special doesn’t it? All my 
                furniture is given the hey-days treatment in my little studio by the 
                sea and sent out into the world via my Etsy shop or locally on Facebook.
